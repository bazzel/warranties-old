# Sample localization file for English. Add more files in this directory for other locales.
# See https://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails%2Flocale for starting points.
#
# Structure based on http://rubyist.info/rails/i18n/

en:
# The `app` node contains keys related to the main application.
#   app:
#     site_name: ...
#     site_description: ...
#     site_headline: ...
#
#
  # The `flash` node contains all flash message keys,
  # regardless the flash type.
  #
  # Tip: avoid prefixing flash keys with the type of the flash
  # because the same message can be reused in different flash types.
  # Also, you might want to change the flash level in the future.
  flash:
    # article_created: "The article has been successfully created."
    # article_updated: "The article has been successfully updated."
    # bookmark_created: "The bookmark has been successfully created."
    warranty_created: "New warranty created."
    warranty_updated: "Warranty updated."


  # The `text` node contains keys shared by more than one view
  # or across the entire application.
  text:
    # Action keys are prefixed with `action_`.
    #
    #   <a href="#"><%= t("text.action_edit") %></a> or
    #   <a href="#"><%= t("text.action_cancel") %></a>
    #
    # action_edit: "edit"
    action_cancel: "Cancel"

    # Button keys are prefixed with `action_`.
    #
    #   <%= submit_tag t("text.button_login") %> or
    #   <a href="#"><%= t("text.action_cancel") %></a>
    #
    # button_login: "Login"
    # button_search: "Search"

    # h1, h2, h3 keys are prefixed with `header_`.
    #
    #   <h1><%= t("text.header_admin_settings") %></h1>
    #
#     header_admin_settings: "Admin Settings"
#     header_content: "Content"
#
#     # Title attribute keys are prefixed with `keys_`.
#     #
#     #   <a href="#" title="<%= t("text.title_goto_site") %>">Hello</a>
#     #
#     title_goto_site: "Go to this site"
#     title_open_page: "Open this page"
#
#     # When the title references a link to a page defined in the
#     # routes.rb file, you SHOULD use the route name in the key.
#     #
#     # This trick reduces the chances that you create a localization string
#     # for the same string more than once.
#     #
#     # <%= link_to "New", new_user_path, :title => t("text.title_new_user_path") %>
#     #
#     title_users_path: "View user list"
#     title_new_user_path: "Create a new user"
    warranties_path: "Warranties"
    destroy_user_session_path: "Sign out"
#
#     # Short messages are prefixed with `message_`.
#     #
#     # <% if @users.empty? %>
#     #   <%= message_users_empty %>
#     # <% else %>
#     #   ...
#     # <% end %>
#     #
#     message_users_empty: "There are no users."
#     message_required_user: "You must be logged to perform this action."
#
#     # Use the placeholder `foo` to reference a variable in the key.
#     suggested_by_foo: "Suggested by {{username}}"
#     published_by_foo: "Published by {{username}}"
#     foo_ago: "{{time}} ago"
    logged_in_as_foo:
      html: Logged in as %{current_user}
#
#     # Use the schema `x_string` to define a key which interpolates a counter.
#     x_comments:
#       one:  "1 comment"
#       other: "{{count}} comments"
#     last_x_users:
#       one:  "Last 1 comment"
#       other: "Last {{count}} comments"

#
  # The ActionController keys follows Rails convention to have a node
  # corresponding to the controller name, including several nodes,
  # one for every controller action.
  #
  # If you follow this convention, you can use the shortcut
  #
  #   t(".meta_description")
  #
  # instead of
  #
  #   t("users_controller.index.meta_description")
  #
  # == Requirements
  #
  # ACTION required keys:
  #
  # title - The content of the <title> tag
  # meta_description - The content of the meta description tag.
  #
  # == Example
  #
  # users_controller:
  #   index:
  #     ...
  #   show:
  #     ...
  #
#   CONTROLLER:
#     ACTION:
#       title: ...
#       meta_description: ...
#     ACTION:
#       title: ...
#       meta_description: ...
#
#
#   # The ActionMailer keys follows the same ActionController conventions.
#   #
#   # The main node is the name of the ActionMailer class. Each sub-node
#   # represents a mailer action.
#   #
#   # == Requirements
#   #
#   # ACTION required keys:
#   #
#   # subject - The subject of the email.
#   #
#   # == Example
#   #
#   # user_mailer:
#   #   notification:
#   #     subject: "[{{project}}] New Contact Message"
#   #   welcome_message:
#   #     subject: "Welcome to {{project}}!"
#   #
#   MAILER:
#     ACTION:
#       subject: "[{{project}}] New Contact Message"
#       ...
#     ACTION:
#       subject: "Welcome to {{project}}!"
